var el = document.getElementById('one');

el.className = 'cool';
// make sure you have the right uppercase letters to use the method correctly 'className' not classname

// we creating a variable to store the node value of the element that as an id of 'one'
/* then via the variable, use dot notation with the classname method to set classname to "cool" which
 triggers a rule in the css to make the background color blue*/
